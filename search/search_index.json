Tags and Resource Groups : Tag : Specify a tag that is attached to the created resource. Tag Key : Choose the tag key. Tag Value : Choose the tag value. Resource Group : Select the resource group to which the created service instance belongs. Create Resource Group : Follow the instructions to Create a Resource Group . After configuring these settings, click Next: Confirm Order . By following these steps, you will ensure that your WebUI credentials and network settings are correctly configured to support your Alibaba Cloud Model Studio RAG service effectively. After setting up these parameters, click Next: Confirm Order . ![Confirm Order](./images/confirm-order.png Step 7: Integrate Gradio for Web UI Use Gradio to create a web interface for interacting with your service: Set up Gradio : Follow Gradio's documentation for installation and configuration. Integrate Services : Connect Gradio to your backend services (Model Studio API endpoints and AnalyticDB for PostgreSQL). Step 8: Deploy Your RAG Service Review all configurations and accept the Terms of Service . Click Create Now to deploy your RAG service. Using the RAG Service General Question Answering Users can ask questions via the Gradio web interface, and the Model Studio API will provide responses based on the input. Uploading Documents for Retrieval Augmentation Users can upload documents which will be stored in the vector database, enhancing the model's retrieval capabilities. Modifying the Service Authorized users can access the ECS instance to make any necessary changes or updates to the service.
